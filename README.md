## AE Certification: The Next(.js) Frontier

You've done well to make it this far!  You're almost done with your Level 1 AE Certification.
As a final step, we'll show you how Vercel's framework-defined infrastructure intelligently deploys your code to its edge network.  Let's find out what it means to be dynamic at the speed of static!


## Let's get started:
1. Click "Fork" in the top nav.  You're going to make your own copy of this repo, where you can make changes and deploy some dynamic code.
2. Normally, you'd set up a new Next.js project locally, but we've set this up so that you can do all your editing inside of Github today.  Just click the "pencil" button on any file you want to edit.
3. <WIP more to come.  Goals: deploy to Vercel to see current state.  Find the Middleware file and make it functional. Use v0.dev to create a new component that you'd want to add, and load it into /pages/v0component.js>
